                  <p id="text04" class="style3"><span class="p"><strong>Q: Were there any inspirations that helped create ‘Persephones Choice’?</strong><br> A: What inspired us most to create Persephone’s Choice was seeing other women in rock absolutely crushing it. It’s totally badass. It pushes us to work even harder to provide that same level of motivation for other women in the scene.</span><span class="p"><strong>Q: If you could open a show for any artist, who would it be?</strong><br> A: We all have such different music tastes, so our list of artists we’d love to open for is pretty diverse. Thunderpussy, Rival Sons, Grace Potter, The Strokes... They all know how to own the stage, and their sound is unmatched. We take a lot of inspiration from them when it comes to writing and stage presence, and it translates well.</span></p>
                  <p id="text08" class="style5"><span class="p">“We want to inspire other young artists to play music and know that they can do anything they set their minds to.”<br> - Lydia</span></p>

                  <p id="text10" class="style3"><span class="p"><strong>Q: What is your creative process like?</strong><br> A: A lot of the songs we’ve written come from a very personal space. They’re all emotionally driven, and each one tells a story if you listen close enough. Most of our songs’ lyrics have been written by Courtney. We all contribute in our own creative ways individually, then come together and build the song up from the lyrics and melody.</span></p>
                  <p id="text11" class="style5">“I’ll just lock myself in my room whenever I’m feeling really intense emotions, and I treat the songwriting as free therapy.” -Courtney</p>
                  <p id="text05" class="style3"><span class="p"><strong>Q: What is everyone's favourite song to perform?</strong><br> A: Our two favorite songs to play live are originals called “Hold Me Down” and “Karma.” They show completely different colors both lyrically and emotionally. “Hold Me Down” was our first ever single, so it’s always going to hold such sentimental value to us (plus it’s fun to dance and groove around the stage with). “Karma” on the other hand carries more intensity just from the meaning behind it. It’s definitely one of our more empowering songs.</span></p>

                  <p id="text12" class="style3"><span class="p"><strong>Q: What first got everyone into music?</strong><br> A: Our inspirations are all so similar and so different at the same time. We all grew up around music in one form or another. Lydia was a huge guitar hero fan when it first came out, especially The Beatles Rockband, and that’s what inspired her to learn how to play guitar for real. Jakob and Caleb grew up with their parents taking them to as many live concerts as possible. Jakob played guitar for about a decade before he fell in love with drums towards the end of high school. He was actually the one who inspired Caleb to start playing music as well. Courtney’s biggest inspiration was Fleetwood Mac. Stevie Nicks is the reason she started singing.</span></p>
                  <p id="text09" class="style5">“Going to concerts and music festivals with my parents while growing up sparked my love and interest for music, but my brother who started playing guitar before me was the inspiration to start playing.” -Caleb</p>

                  <p id="text24" class="style3"><span class="p"><strong>Q: What’s next for Persephones Choice?</strong><br> A: We have a lot of new music coming this year that we’re very excited to share with everyone! We’ve been working really hard since day one to pursue our dreams, and we’re so thankful for how loving and supportive everyone has been on this journey of ours.</span></p>
